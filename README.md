# Dataset Description

This dataset was developed for a graduate-level Data Mining course project focused on detecting fake news in Turkish using BERT-based models. It consists of short news claims and statements labeled as either fake or real, intended for use in binary classification tasks.

## Structure

- **Content**: The text of the news claim or statement (in Turkish).
- **Label**: Binary indicator of the claim’s truthfulness (`1` = fake, `0` = real).

## Sources

The dataset is compiled from multiple publicly available and credible resources, including:

- **Sosyalan**: A Turkish fake news dataset curated from social media and news platforms.
- **Doğruluk Payı and Teyit**: Turkish fact-checking platforms providing verified political and social claims.
- **X-Fact** and **FCTR** datasets: Public datasets that include fake/real news content in Turkish, commonly used in academic research.
